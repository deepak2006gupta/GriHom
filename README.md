## 🏗️ How the Valor Score Works

The **Valor Score** (0–100) is computed by `valorCalculator.js` based on:

- **Property age** — Newer homes start with a higher base
- **Location tier** — Premium city zones get a score boost
- **Improvements applied** — Each upgrade contributes an `impact` value

Recommendations are then generated by:
1. Filtering improvements by your budget tier (Low / Medium / High)
2. Sorting by ROI priority (High → Medium → Low)
3. Returning the top 5 highest-impact upgrades

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fresh Paint (Asian Paints) | Low | High | +8 | ₹15K–₹50K |
| Modular Kitchen Upgrade | High | High | +20 | ₹1L–₹3L |
| Western Toilet Upgrade | Medium | High | +12 | ₹25K–₹60K |
| False Ceiling + LED Lights | Medium | Medium | +10 | ₹40K–₹80K |
| Custom Wardrobe | Medium | High | +15 | ₹30K–₹80K |
| Main Door Upgrade | Medium | Medium | +7 | ₹15K–₹40K |
| Balcony Grill & Safety Nets | Low | Medium | +5 | ₹8K–₹20K |
| RO Water Purifier | Low | Medium | +4 | ₹8K–₹20K |

## 🔒 Auth & Roles

- **Guest** — Browse ideas, explore the home page
- **User** — Generate reports, save to dashboard, view history
- **Admin** — Access admin panel to manage users and data

Authentication is handled via `apiService` (currently mock-ready; swap in a real backend endpoint as needed).
